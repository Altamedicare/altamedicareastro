# I18N Port Log — Vernal → Alta (Phase 0)

Upstream: `../vernalmedicareastro` (v2 of the multilingual framework; playbook:
`Multilingual_Astro_Playbook.pdf`). This log classifies **every modification**
made while porting, so the eventual framework extraction knows which
differences are architectural and which are project-specific.

Classification key:
- **[GENERIC]** — improvement that should flow back into the reusable framework
- **[ALTA]** — Alta-specific adaptation; belongs only in this repo
- **[LEGACY]** — Vernal assumption that should be eliminated from the framework

## Files ported

| Alta file | Upstream | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `src/i18n/locales.ts` | `src/i18n/locales.ts` | ported, chrome dictionary reset |
| `src/i18n/content.ts` | `src/i18n/content.ts` | ported, origin + policy notes changed |
| `src/i18n/content-pages.ts` | `src/i18n/content-pages.ts` | ported, registry emptied (spike page only) |
| `src/i18n/glossary.json` | `src/i18n/glossary.json` | ported, brand terms swapped |
| `scripts/translate.js` | `scripts/translate.js` | ported verbatim except branding |
| `src/pages/[locale]/[...path].astro` | same path | ported, component map emptied |
| `scripts/i18n-diff.mjs` | *(none — Vernal ran diffs ad hoc)* | new |

## Changes, classified

### [GENERIC] — should flow upstream into the framework
- **`scripts/i18n-diff.mjs`**: the playbook's 3-diff verification (tag
  structure / visible text / entity-leak scan) as a committed, cross-platform
  Node script instead of the ad-hoc bash+perl snippet. Vernal never committed
  its harness; every future site should get this file as-is.
- **`content.ts` URL-policy comment** now states explicitly that multi-segment
  paths pass through `localizeHref` unrewritten. This was implicit in Vernal
  (it had no nested pages); making the boundary explicit is a framework
  improvement (and a Phase 2 extension point — see [ALTA] below).

### [ALTA] — project-specific; do not generalize
- `SITE_ORIGIN = 'https://altamedicare.com'` in `content.ts`.
- Glossary brand terms: `AltaMedicare`, `Bret Swope`, `SunFire` verbatim;
  dropped Vernal's `Uintah Basin`; added `Low Income Subsidy` (used on Alta's
  dual-eligible/drug-savings pages). CMS-pinned Spanish terms carried over
  unchanged — they are regulator vocabulary, not project data.
- `translate.js` system prompt branding (altamedicare.com / Bret Swope / Orem).
- **Nested-page clusters** (`utah/…`, `faq/…`, `blog/…`): `localizeHref` only
  rewrites single-segment `.html` links; nested paths pass through to the
  English page. Correct for launch (those clusters are outside the ES
  boundary), but Phase 2 (places/faq as translation sources) will need
  multi-segment support — that extension is Alta's contribution and should
  then flow upstream, reclassified as [GENERIC].
- Chrome dictionary (`strings`) and `LABELS` in `locales.ts` reset to
  near-empty: the INVARIANT (every `en` value byte-identical to the component
  literal it replaces) means entries can only be added while localizing Alta's
  actual chrome (Phase 1). Vernal's entries were Vernal's literals.

### [LEGACY] — Vernal assumptions removed / flagged
- Header comments referencing Vernal milestone numbers ("Phase A.5",
  "Milestone 2", "M3/M44") stripped. The framework should not carry one
  project's roadmap labels.
- Vernal's `content-pages.ts` registry and `[...path].astro` COMPONENTS map
  enumerated 16 Vernal pages — emptied here. **Framework note:** the component
  map + registry pairing is boilerplate every site re-fills by hand; the
  extraction should consider generating both from one declaration.
- Vernal is Astro 6 / Alta is Astro 4.16: no code changes were required
  (`import.meta.glob`, dynamic routes, and `set:html` behave identically), but
  the framework extraction must not assume Astro 6-only APIs.
- Vernal's `verify.mjs` (vitest + astro-check ratchet) was **not** ported —
  Alta has no test suite or typecheck baseline yet. Decide separately whether
  to adopt it; it is quality infrastructure, not part of the i18n system.

## Environment / decisions record
- **No Astro i18n config block** — same as Vernal: localized routes come
  entirely from the dynamic route + `format:'file'` naming. `astro.config.mjs`
  comment updated (also fixed its stale claim that the sitemap is
  hand-maintained; it's generated at `src/pages/sitemap.xml.ts`).
- Model `claude-opus-4-8` at $5/$25 per MTok re-verified current 2026-07-01
  via the claude-api reference; engine's API usage (structured outputs via
  `output_config.format`, adaptive thinking, streaming) is current.
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk` intentionally **not** added to package.json yet —
  `--check`/`--dry-run` need no SDK; add it when Phase 1 runs live translation.
- New npm scripts: `translate`, `i18n-diff`.

## Extraction spike (about.html)
- `src/pages/about.astro` → `src/i18n/content/en/about.json`, lossless:
  HTML-bearing strings stored verbatim (entities included) and rendered via
  `set:html`; phone display tokenized as `{phone}` from `consts.PHONE_DISPLAY`
  (§6.8). Registered in `content-pages.ts`. 3-diff result recorded below.

### 3-diff record
- **Extraction spike** (about.astro → JSON, rendered in place): ✓ tag
  structure (584 tags) / ✓ visible text (3381 glyphs) / ✓ zero entity leaks.
- **Componentization** (AboutPage.astro shared component + thin wrapper +
  COMPONENTS registration): re-diffed against both the post-extraction and
  the original pre-extraction snapshots — all ✓.
- **Chrome-link refactor** (MainLayout page hrefs → `localizeHref`, `<html
  lang>` → derived): index.html (1223 tags / 8526 glyphs) and contact.html
  (669 tags / 2750 glyphs) both ✓ — `localizeHref` is an identity for the
  default locale, so English output is glyph-stable site-wide.

## Post-Phase-0 session (first localized page loop)

- **[GENERIC]** `MainLayout.astro` made locale-aware: `lang` derives from
  `getLangFromUrl(Astro.url)` (no prop threading), all 35 chrome page-link
  hrefs route through a `href()` helper wrapping `localizeHref`. Chrome TEXT
  remains English pending the Phase 1 chrome milestone.
- **[GENERIC]** `AboutPage.astro` injects hreflang alternates + `og:locale`
  through MainLayout's existing `<slot name="head">` — per-page, existence-
  aware head additions with zero layout changes. Pattern worth keeping.
- **[ALTA]** Relative asset paths (`images/bret-photo.svg`) break under
  `/es/`; AboutPage carries a local `asset()` absolutizer (identity for the
  default locale). Generalize into content.ts when a second page needs it.
- **[ALTA]** `@anthropic-ai/sdk` added to devDependencies. Live translation
  ran 2026-07-02: es/about.json (26/26 segments, $0.05), validator green.
  Committed + tagged `i18n-batch-1`.

## Chrome milestone (tag: i18n-chrome)

- **Glossary**: pinned `Medicare Supplement → Seguro Suplementario de
  Medicare` (CMS vocabulary); corrected the one committed occurrence in
  es/about.json ("Complementario" → "Suplementario"); `--check` green.
  Seeding makes the hand-correction authoritative (§9).
- **[ALTA]** `src/i18n/compliance.ts`: TPMO multi-plan disclaimer (footer,
  every page). English byte-identical to the previous literal; Spanish is the
  CMS-published wording (structure ported from Vernal's
  `businessDisclaimers()`, text adapted to Alta's SHIP-variant English).
  NEVER machine-translated.
- **[ALTA]** Chrome `t()` dictionary populated: 48 keys (nav, footer, chat
  panel, aria labels, search-modal shell). Every `en` value byte-identical to
  the literal it replaced — verified by 3-diff (index/contact glyph-identical
  after the conversion). `es` values hand-authored, reusing Vernal's vetted
  labels where the English matched. Native-speaker review still pending
  (YMYL rule: machine rules necessary, not sufficient).
- **[GENERIC]** `LanguageSwitcher.astro`: existence-aware (renders nothing on
  untranslated pages — verified: index/contact emit no switcher and are
  byte-identical); current language links to itself; scoped styles.
  Mounted in MainLayout's `.header-cta`.
- **Verification record**: untranslated EN pages glyph-identical; EN about's
  ONLY delta is the switcher block (proven by strip-and-rediff); /es/about
  chrome fully Spanish (nav, footer, disclaimer, chat, arias), zero relative
  links, `--check` green.
- **Documented boundaries (still English by design)**: Pagefind search-modal
  runtime strings (inline JS — needs a lang-keyed dictionary, Phase 1+ item);
  MedicareNews ticker + items (news is outside the launch boundary);
  "powered by" footer credit.
